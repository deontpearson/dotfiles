# My Environment

A collection of dotfiles, scripts, aliases, and functions I use on my work / development machine.

## dotfiles

All dotfiles are stored in the `dotfiles` directory. They are symlinked to their respective directories using the `setup.sh` script.

## bin

All my custom binaries are stored in the `bin` directory and sourced in the `.zprofile` file.

## custom

All my custom aliases and functions are stored in the `custom` directory and sourced in the `.zshrc` file.

## private

All my private aliases and functions are stored in the `private` directory and sourced in the `.zshrc` file.
